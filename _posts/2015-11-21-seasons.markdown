*Eating what a certain season has to offer, obviously in spring different vegetables and fruits grow then for example during winter. But why would you eat with the seasons? Are there any benefits? And what about eating what your region has to offer?*

I am trying my best at eating with what each season has to offer. I have to say, being here in Spain, it is not very hard at all. From September up until two weeks ago I picked pomegranates from the tree. Same goes for almonds, we are still harvesting and cracking those as we speak. But currently we are also harvesting all the tomatoes. (In November!) Now that there is frost during the nights they all have to be harvested but still, fresh tomatoes and cherry tomatoes in November! Of course in colder countries this is a whole different story. Is it more difficult to eat with the seasons in for example the Netherlands? Maybe first let’s see what is in season during each season. 

**Spring**
Veggies: Cucumber, courgette, beans, peas and new potatoes. Fruits: Avocados, berries, cherries, melons, plums and peaches.
**Summer**
Veggies: Corn, aubergine, pepper, okra. Fruit: Apples, figs, grapes, watermelon, tomatoes.
**Fall**
Veggies: Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, pumpkin and sweet potatoes. Fruit: Coconut, pomegranate, pears.
**Winter**
Veggies: Carrots, celery roots, turnip and leeks. Fruit: Kumquats, kiwi, pineapple and dates. 
**All year round**
Veggies: Beets, celery, ginger, onions, spinach, garlic.  Fruit: Passion fruit, banana, citrus.

This is *not* a full list. Go [here](http://shop.chasingdelicious.com/)  to find very handy graphics with more info which I really like to use. I made this list to give you an idea of what your options can be.

So why would one eat what its own region has to offer? Well I think the first obvious reason is to support your local community. Instead of supporting big commercial companies. Also once a vegetable/fruit is harvested they lose lots of their nutritional value after a certain period of time. For example spinach loses 90% of its vitamin C within 24 hours. So if for example a fruit has traveled all the way from South America to Europe how much of its nutritional value is left?

So what if you live in a colder country where the warm season is shorter and certain products simply do not grow (as long)? My advice is to try to buy as locally as you can. But if at times you like a banana, pineapple etc. I would buy it fairtrade and organic.
