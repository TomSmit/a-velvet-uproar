*In October we visited Valencia and what a fantastic city! There is lots to do and lots to see. It’s filled with a lot of vegan and fun vintage options. Plus it has a huge park so enough green to enjoy a more quiet day. Yes, I definitely fell in love with this city!*

Our airbnb was located at the edge of the neighborhood ‘Rusaffa’ (in Valencian) or ‘Ruzafa’ (in Spanish). This neighborhood is kind of new and upcoming with loads of nice little cafes, good restaurants and fun stores! The city center of Valencia was about a 30 minute walk away and a bus stop was right by our apartment as well. We did most on foot though. On our very first day Tom and I got ourselves a tattoo at ‘[Bonjour Tattoo Parlour](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBonjour-Tattoo-Parlour-1494242827527493%2F%3Ffref%3Dts&t=OGFmMGNlNTA2NzY4NWM4OTM2OGRiNGJlODEzYTFjZDBjODY5ZjFmYixDUDA4QlhjZw%3D%3D)’! We had been thinking about it for quite sometime and Valencia seemed like the perfect place to get them!

**Restaurants**\
I will first talk a bit more about the restaurants we went to. Of course we could not go to all the restaurants I would have liked to but these two were wonderful and I can definitely recommend them! On the day we arrived Tom and I had lunch at Miobio. A vegan restaurant located in Russafa. The food was amazing! Plus a nice little detail is, on weekdays they have a buffet and you fill up your plate with whatever you’d like and how much you would like! They weigh your plate, so you pay for the amount of food you decide to put on your plate. Wonderful! If you are in Valencia I definitely recommend you going here, the food is amazing, the staff is really nice and the restaurant itself looks lovely as well! A perfect combination if you ask me.

The other restaurant we went to is called 'La Tasta Olletes’ and this is a vegetarian restaurant. We found this one, while we visited the IVAM. So yes it was a bit of a coincidence but none the less the food was wonderful. This restaurant is vegetarian but with enough vegan options as well! I had a delicious vegan brownie for dessert!

**Markets\
**The Russafa market was 10 minutes away by foot from our apartment and definitely worth a visit! It is an indoor market filled with endless food stands, yes heaven indeed! I think it is a wonderful and real Spanish experience. It is such a lively place and English is hardly spoken.

Then you have the Mercado Central as well, which is located in the city center. Similar to the Russafa market but bigger and when you are inside you have to look up! Wow, the ceiling or better, the whole building is beautiful! One down side, this market is quite touristy, it is a very known place to visit. This is why I prefer the Russafa market. Less tourists and more locals!

**Vintage stores\
**There are tons of vintage stores to visit in Valencia, I will give you the two I visited. Both are located in Russafa. The first one I visited is called 'Petticoat Vintage Lab’. A stylish, fresh looking store with cool clothing. I especially liked the nice dresses, fun tops and cool jackets!

The second one I visited is called 'Garage Vintage’. A nice and spacious shop filled with cool and fun clothing! I had to tell myself a couple times I truly cannot fit anything else in my backpack and yes it was a bit difficult!

**More fun stuff!\
**I also visited an all vegan and Eco store called 'Respetarte’. Filled with nice, healthy food and the owners are really kind! [Respetarte](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRESPETARTE.Ecotienda%2F%3Ffref%3Dts&t=NzUyNGVkMjg5MjRlM2U1MjJlNjU2ZmNjNGE5NTVjNmVjMzdkMWM5MCxDUDA4QlhjZw%3D%3D), Calle Matias Perello 9. While in Valencia I was determined to find cosmetics which are vegan and as natural as possible. (BTW more on this subject in a future post!) I found them at ’[Herborlario Navarro](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fherbolarionavarro%2F%3Ffref%3Dts&t=ZGVhNzg1ODgzY2JiODdmYjg5Y2JhZmIwYmIzMzI4OTFmOTFiMmNkYSxDUDA4QlhjZw%3D%3D)’ an awesome super market! Stacked with vegan and gluten free options! As well as the cosmetics I was looking for! YAY! \
\
We also visited the IVAM. The museum of modern arts of Valencia. If I am in a city I have to visit their art museum! It is a spacious museum filled with interesting art! I saw some art work of ‘De Stijl’ which I found quite interesting in particular.

There is a big nature park close to Valencia called Albufera. By bus it takes about 20-30 minutes to get there. It is a really lovely place. On one side you have a big lake and on the other the sea! We walked through the park and headed for the sea. On the day we visited Albufera it was quite cloudy and windy, so the sea was quite rough! We had a little picknick eating fruits, carrots with guacamole and some tortilla chips with hummus. Yum!

We left on the 16th, which was on a Friday. The original plan was to stay until Tuesday but extended our stay until Thursday due to the fact we did not have another place to go yet! Finally, with lots of trust in knowing the future will always, somehow unfold itself we heard back from an exciting new host! We could come to their place on the 23rd also on a Friday so our last night we stayed in a hostel right next to the Russafa market!

On Thursday (basically our last day) we realized while in Valencia we had not tried the typical and local drink yet called 'Horchata’. A drink made out of tiger nuts, water and sugar. So we decided to share one and see what it is like. It was quite sweet but tasty! Further on in the day we decided we wanted a nice and relaxing day and headed for the big park, which kind of wraps itself around the city. The park is called Jardi del Turia.

*That was my wonderful week, spent in a wonderful, exciting city! While I was in Valencia the website [happycow](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.happycow.net%2F&t=MzkzZmU1NjU4M2EyMmQ5M2U0MTJhNjc4OWZmODJkYTk1NzZhMjExZixDUDA4QlhjZw%3D%3D) was a great use to find vegan restaurants! Plus in the shop 'Respetarte’ they told me about this other handy website called [vegandir](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegandir.com%2F&t=MTlhOWNjNGFiMDk0NTdmNGFlZWM1MWViMjFlYmEwMWViYTNkNzY0OSxDUDA4QlhjZw%3D%3D)! The last one is only for Spain though!*

Guys enjoy life, your travels, new places and good food!
