*I have been vegan for 3 months now. Maybe one of the biggest changes which happened compared to 3 months ago is when I first started I would have said I eat vegan. Now 3 months later I say I am vegan. Within these 3 months I have become aware of a lot and learned a lot. Today I like to share with you what the past three months have been like, how I feel physically but maybe most importantly how I feel about all the things I have become aware of.*

First of yes, being vegan is fun! The reasons why are for example learning about all these exciting new products, endless possibilities and hours spend in the kitchen making new dishes, learning more and more about ingredients and which flavors go with what. Yes, this has sparked such an interest in me, I had no clue I had. But maybe even far more importantly it made me (more) conscious of what I buy and why I decide not too buy other products. Yes, this obviously goes for food but also for cosmetics, clothing etc. It made me aware of the huge amount of animals which are being used for testing. Learning more about leather, fur and wool. Clothing lots of us use daily which are made out of animals. It is horrific to see what happens to the cows which are going to be used to make for example coats, shoes and bags from. Do I really want and more importantly do I need to wear dead skin of an animal? No.

I have talked about cosmetics and wool before and of course there is still lots of ground to cover. What I hope to do is to spark an interest in people, even if it is only one or two people. Changes have to start somewhere, no matter how big or small.

To me it is very important to know what all these animals go through in slaughterhouses but also when they are used as entertainment. No, never a zoo for me. I never understood what we should like about looking at animals caged in, in a space so much smaller than their natural habitat. Also circuses, hunting, fishing, animal testing. Somehow people tend to think all these animals live to serve us. Or as if we have a right to do all these things to them when clearly we do not. They are as much part of this world as we are.

Do we ever wonder what this huge demand on meat and dairy products is doing to our planet? We are destroying the planet we live on. If you are interested in learning more about this subject I would highly recommend you watching ’Cowspiracy’. I recently also wrote a review about this documentary.

Besides what this is doing to the animals and the planet, what is it doing to our health and our bodies? Diseases such as cancer and diabetes are directly linked with consuming meat and dairy products. How are our organs reacting to all these products? Our health is declining because of all these animal products, the human body is not build for.

I feel ever since becoming (more) aware of the food I consciously choose to eat and the products I consciously choose to buy I feel happy and proud of myself. Yes is feels good to know I am no longer contributing to this horror. Of course I still have lots to learn and I am far from perfect but I feel like at least I am doing something about the things I disagree with. Plus I consciously choose which things I want to support and help.

There is far more to learn. I have far more to learn, I mean, I think we all do. The more people become aware of what is truly going on the better. I believe change comes from spreading awareness. 

I wanted to give you a little update on how my past 3 months have been and how inspired and excited I am for the future. The future is full of potential and possibilities and we can all be part of it. We all have to become part of it.
