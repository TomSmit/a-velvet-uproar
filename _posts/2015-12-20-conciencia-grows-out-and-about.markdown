*While we were staying at Conciencia Grows, close to Madrid, we went and saw quite some wonderful other places as well. Today I would like to share them with you!*

We went to a beautiful little town called Chinchón for an afternoon. We wandered around and found the Plaza Mayor. This plaza to us is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Beautiful, simply because the plaza is beautiful. But horrific of the bullfighting which takes place here each year over and over again. It was hard to imagine something like that happening because when we were there is what quiet en peaceful. People sitting outside, enjoying their coffee and a tapa. But of course Chinchón is also a town with amazing old, little houses and shops.

We walked towards the church ‘Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción’ and enjoyed this beautiful view! By the way inside the church there is a mural painted by Goya, when we were there though the church was closed.

On another day we came along with Kahlyn and Ramón when they had a market to go to. The little town we went to was old but everything was well maintained. We walked around the little town and took a walk into the country side. Spain is so very beautiful, truly really!

Black olives grew everywhere right along the road. First I was taking pictures of some olives growing on another tree but an elderly, friendly Spanish man told us about another tree right around the corner where the olives were even more impressive. And he was right!

Yes, even Spain can be gray and wet sometimes. OK I’ll be honest. It is not gray and wet very often but it does happen during the colder months. In early November we went mushroom ‘hunting’ together with some wonderful and very nice people! We headed for El Hoyo de Pinares. Níscalos (or red pine ring) were the type of mushrooms we were looking for. No worries the people we were with had picked them before so they knew which ones were the good ones!

This is all we found even though we were with nine people. But when we were loading up the car two very happy and pleased men walked passed us with tons of the type of mushroom we were looking for. They most probably arrived a bit earlier then we did, unfortunately.

Carlos and Celia were the wonderful couple we visited and who live close to the forest where we went mushroom ‘hunting’. They also grow and sell their crops but they also produce and sell their own olive oil and other herbal oils as well as red wine! The plant pictured below is a stevia plant!

Of course we grilled the mushrooms Spanish style. A simple but sufficient self build BBQ but it works perfectly. Along with the mushrooms we, of course, grilled some other veggies as well and we enjoyed a vegetable paella prepared by Tom! Yum!

While we enjoyed our food chickens and ducks were walking around and enjoying themselves.

On November 8th, a day before my grandma passed away (two years ago) Tom and I took a nice walk. We walked through the neighborhood close by and walked up the hills. Tom looked so beautiful while the sun was setting. The sun made him turn into this beautiful warm golden color.

*I keep repeating myself but traveling is magic. We have met so many kind and welcoming people. I learned time is the strangest concept ever. And somehow life is always good.*
