*After our two week stay with my mom in Málaga we headed to our new hosts at [Finca la Sacristia](http://fincalasacristia.com/). Not far from Málaga it was the perfect new place to be. From Málaga’s city center we took a bus to Rincon de la Victoria and it was about a 30 minute drive. We were picked up by Hannes and the drive to the finca took us another 30 minutes. We left Málaga in the morning and around 11 AM we arrived at this magical place.*

We stayed in our own caravan, right next to an almond tree for six wonderful weeks. Finca La Sacristia is located on top of a hill. It is made up from about 7 different caravans together with some wooden houses, a straw bale yoga house and the main kitchen area is located on top of the hill. With compost toilets, yes that means no flushing just throwing some straw and/or some earth down the hole when you are done. Funny enough after about two days, it was completely normal. They also use a solar oven. Yes it is exactly what is sounds like, cooking your food with the heat of the sun. No gas and fire needed! You put your potatoes, rice, veggies (whatever you’d like!) into the oven at around 10 AM and at 2 PM it is ready to eat and you do not have to do anything, just let the sun do its job! Wonderful vegan and big lunches were always prepared, Mmm.

They have the cutest kittens, the most kind people and the place was filled with music every single day. And of course the endless amount of tasty figs and wonderful almonds! They have two vegetable gardens and one of them is a greenhouse! Tom and I took the watering upon us. Plus Tom also helped built two rooftops, I helped with the almond harvesting but also with harvesting figs and grapes! We did yoga, Indian classical music circles, a compassionate communication ‘workshop’, and an inner voice 'workshop’.

I fasted and got dreadlocks (but more on both in another blog post!) and of course we got to know and learned lots about veganfood! We met inspiring fellow vegans and fruiterians! Starting off, eating vegan was not always easy. In the beginning I had a craving for butter and bread. But after about three weeks I truly started to notice the cravings were getting less and less and at some point they were completely gone. It was easy to continue (even after we left Finca la Sacristia) because I felt so much more energetic, 'light’ and healthy. I also learned about the Moringa tree, also known as the 'miracle tree’. (It got its nickname because of its high nutritional and herbal medicinal properties of the leaves, flowers and fruits.) Its leaves taste great in salads by the way and among other things contain beta-carotene, vitamin C, protein, iron and potassium! The seeds of the tree can be used to purify water, since they are able to pick up to 98 percent of impurities and micro-organisms from water. Something I found on the internet that I found quite interesting:
One hundred grams of dry moringa leaf contains
- 9 times the protein of yogurt
- 10 times the vitamin A of carrots
- 15 times the potassium of bananas
- 17 times the calcium of milk
- 12 times the vitamin C of oranges
- 25 times the iron of spinach

*Anyway, thanks again to everyone who made our stay so inspiring and wonderful. It truly was such a joy to be here for six weeks! Thank you, thank you, thank you!*
