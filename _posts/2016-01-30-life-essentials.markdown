*Lately I have been thinking quite a bit about what I find important in life. Thoughts such as how do I put my beliefs, my opinions, the things I stand for on paper? And how do I get myself where I want to be spiritually, morally, even physically and consciously? Today a little something on my life essentials.*

I have learned what I need in life; a somewhat different kind of living. It is not even the longing for the open road, it is the longing for new people, new situations, new experiences. Creating new possibilities and opportunities every single day. Right next to that, there is the need to express my opinions, my disbeliefs, my findings, my shock, my confusion, my love for life, people, colors, the madness, the beauty and the horror. Along with learning by doing in fields such as growing ones own organic food, sharing, sustainable building and thus living.

These days my life essentials consist out of a backpack, written and spoken words, the sun (oh the sun, I want you forever), paint, love, food and water.

The past couple of months I have been focusing hard on what I find important in life for myself, others, animals, the planet and the future. With this there came about quite some changes. The main ones being, being vegan and my plastic consumption. I try to reduce the amount of plastic I use such as plastic bags, plastic wrappers etc. I am on a journey and from time to time reducing the plastic consumption can be difficult. (Especially when I am staying at other people’s places. You can inspire them but you cannot tell them what to do.) That said, I am a firm believer of ‘small changes are better than no changes at all’.

Top: bamboo, vegan toothbrushes and coconut oil used as deodorant. Bottom: reusable cotton bags, a reusable bottle and glass and a stainless steel lunchbox. I guess these items you could call somewhat more of the materialistic life essentials.

*Focusing on your own thoughts and opinions is, I think, necessary to clear your mind and to grow further. Everyone needs to focus on themselves from time to time. I am looking for change and I think the best beginning is by starting with myself.*
