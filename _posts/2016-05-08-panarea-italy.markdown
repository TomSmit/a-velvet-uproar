*I will never forget the first time I saw cacti and agaves growing outside. No greenhouses needed. We had just arrived in Andalusia and when I saw all the cacti and agaves my heart was beaming with pure excitement, I was overwhelmed by their beauty. Never, never ever will I forget that moment. The beauty of the Earth struck me and looking back now, right that moment certain puzzle pieces fell into place. I realized, but realized in such a way that the thought is still very present in my mind, what is important to me and what is not. Our seven weeks at Panarea were if like, I was living that realization.*

Before we headed for Panarea we were in Rome. From Rome we headed for Napoli (Naples in English) by train. We had booked a ferry from Napoli to Panarea, the journey would approx. take about 11 hours. We left Napoli about 8PM and arrived at Panarea at about 9AM. So in the end the journey took just a bit longer than expected. I remember thinking like ‘Wow, we are really far out on the sea.’ That thought lasted until I saw the outline of Sicily. Haha! Tom and I woke up early, ‘round about 6AM and we watched  the ferry dock at Stromboli on one side of the island and then on the other side of the island while smoke was coming out of the crater. Several people have told us that when it gets dark you can see it light up every twenty minutes or so. Holy shit.

*Pictured above; Rosemary and Pelargonium Graveolens. Every morning and late afternoon, during our walk, we would smell them.*

Once we docked at Panarea another HelpXer named Summer picked us up from the port. Maybe good to know, to understand a bit more about our stay there, the actual hosts were not there when we were. Approx. for six months when they are not there, they need people to look after their animals, their house etc. Of course we did not just look after their animals, I mean of course we did do other things as well but that was the main priority. Summer and Tasia were the HelpXers which were there before us and they were there for a week more before they continued their travels. Summer and Tasia, if you read this, I think we never thanked you properly for your kindness and making us feel right at home from the start. Really, truly thank you.

I remember when they left I was a bit nervous. I remember thinking ‘Oh shit, all the animals are our complete responsibility now.’ Don´t get me wrong, I do believe I can take care of animals; love them, cuddle them, feed them… But you are taking care of someone else’s animals. It got me a bit nervous at first but I also found so much tender beauty in the fact of how much fate and believe the hosts have in the people they decide to invite and to let them stay at their place and to let them take care of their animals. You know, mankind can be so gentle, warm hearted and kind. I think, that is what it taught me above all. 

Panarea is beautiful. Every centimeter of the 3 square kilometers that Panarea exists out of is beautiful. You might be thinking, okay but you say that about every place you have visited and yes that’s true. Because every place holds so much beauty. Some places though have this beauty which needs to be shared. It is so beautiful, calming and inviting that it wants to be shared with other people. I think, almost everyday I thought ‘I wish I could show my family this.’ One time when Tom and I were hiking, I told him “There is this quote ‘Happiness is only real when shared’ from the movie ‘Into The Wild’ and now, I completely like, to the core understand those words.”

This time around I decided to not try and write down why I think, this place, is so beautiful. I decided to try and let the pictures I took do the talking.

We stayed at ‘Casa Cactus’ this is the house where we slept. There are five cats there and man, really every single cat has an interesting character. Cats in general tend to have interesting characters I think. They like their food, sunbathing, some like to cuddle, another likes to spray. Haha! Then, in the mornings we walked to ‘Villa Liberta’ which took us about twenty minutes. Over there, there are the three donkeys, two other cats and about twenty hens and seven roosters. FYI seven roosters means lots of noise. Plus I started this club together with a donkey and a female cat. The only female cat out of the seven by the way. The female cat is called Daisy and the female donkey is called Loulou. What all three of us have in common? We are the short ones. I even came up with a slogan ‘The smallest are the nicest!’ But I used to say the slogan in Dutch and I have to say in Dutch the slogan is a bit more catchy. ‘De kleinste zijn de fijnste!’ In Dutch, at least, it rhymes, haha! 

Tom and even I got into baking. Bread, muffins, cakes. I think neither of us had even baked that much in our lives! It was exciting and delicious. And unfortunately, with all the spelt I ate, together with cookies made out of oats, it brought back my craving for bread. Which had left me about six weeks after I started eating gluten free back in August of last year. So yes, I am trying to tackle that once more right now. Plus, I cannot recall when it exactly happened but my love for flowers has seriously grown, ever since we started traveling. Making flower bouquets, oh, the colors. It’s instant happiness. Like really; -poof- flowers, -poof- happiness. At least, okay, that is what it is like for me.

I have to be honest, this post feels a bit scattered. I talk a bit about this, oh yes and this as well and I want to talk about this also! But at the same time I have this strong urge of just wanting to show you my pictures and leaving it at that. I am so grateful to have been able to go to Panarea, I miss the animals, the place. The beauty is still very much stuck into my mind, thankfully. During our stay I have thought about some stuff, realized some stuff and those are for another post but what it comes down to I think is this; I am so extremely grateful and thankful for life. I feel like I know what real and honest happiness is. If like I shook its hand and right away it dug its way into my heart. I feel like I am no longer searching, well, I am still searching but now it is a different kind of searching.

We very much enjoyed our time spent with the animals and working outside (building a permaculture, raised garden beds and an herbal spiral) more on that in a future post! But we also took a walk on our 4,5 year anniversary and enjoyed some time next to the sea. On that specific day, it was really warm. The temperature got up to 28 degrees Celsius, it was awesome. I loved it. Plus on another day, we hiked around the island, it is a 2,5 to 3 hour hike. The view at the top was incredible. Overlooking all the islands, the clear blue sky and the calm blue sea. It was like the Earth was shoving her beauty in our faces but in like a very delicate way.

*Pictured below; Tom’s self built solar oven! Doesn’t it look awesome? It got up to a 130 degrees Celsius!*

*Guys, man, really. I don’t know. Life, I just simply really like you a lot.*
