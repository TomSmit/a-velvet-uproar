*Casa de la Finestra is named after a hole in a mountain, which can be seen from their house. ‘La Finestra’ translates to 'the window’. Funny enough, this is only in Catalan and Valencian (and Italian). Valencian is a dialect of Catalan but I think people from the Valencian Provence would disagree and say it is a different language to Catalan. In Spanish 'the window’ would be 'la ventana’.*

Tom and I felt like we could not leave Casa de la Finestra without hiking up to La Finestra. We just had to go there and see the hole for ourselves. The first bit we drove up by car because other wise, just getting up there, starting from the house would take us at least 5 to 6 hours. We drove for about 20 minutes until we could not drive up any higher and we set off on foot. 

The hike was quite a challenge at some points. You just keep walking up and up, with no flat terrain whatsoever. Some rocks were taller than my legs so Tom had to give me a hand and help me. So I was able to climb up these rocks. Yes, for this hike you definitely need good shoes/boots and a good amount of water. It took us about an hour to reach 'La Finestra’. But it was truly worth it. The view was so beautiful and seeing the hole up close, it was so big! From faraway the hole is almost hard to spot!

The feeling it can give you when you do something when you thought “I am gonna sit here and not move any further.” is magical. When you do and reach your goal, that’s powerful!

When we reached 'La Finestra’ we sat down and had a little fruit picknick to fill up our stomach. We enjoyed the view while we relaxed for a little bit. We sat down for about 45 minutes and then it was time to head back. Hm, I might have underestimated the walk back down. I thought “Oh, walking back down is going to be easy peasy!”. But walking back down when nothing, nothing is flat gets quite painful for your toes. At least mine were getting painful because I kept tension on them the whole hike back. Due to trying to keep myself balanced. 

Once we got back to the car, about another 45 minutes later, I felt satisfied. Glad to have seen 'La Finestra’ and to have actually hiked up and down. 

Challenging yourself and doing something physical can be eye opening. To see yourself in another light or to reach a point which you set in your mind can be satisfying. At least that is what I experienced. Seeing beautiful view after beautiful view, breathing in fresh air and challenging myself, yes that is what made this a wonderful day.

*Here is to pushing your boundaries, enjoying life and sharing it with people you love!*
