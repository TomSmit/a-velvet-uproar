*I’m back in the Netherlands and so writing this blog post somehow is a bit strange. It makes me feel a bit disconnected, a bit in-between everything and nothing. It makes me feel confused but excited. Less than a week ago we were in Spain, lovely and amazing Spain. As soon as I leave, I miss it. So this post might end up being, me juggling with memories and emotions. But that’s fine, I think.*

After our stay at Panarea, Italy, we headed for Sicily by hydrofoil on the 27th of April. Once we got to Milazzo, we took the bus to Catania. Catania is Sicily’s second biggest city after Palermo. Plus Catania is located right next to Mount Etna. (Which is the tallest active volcano in Europe and is more than 3km high.) Our flight to Barcelona left the next day so we had some time to explore Catania. We strolled through streets, had lunch at Haiku, an all vegan restaurant and they can be found at Via Quintino Sella 28 plus I went to some vintage shops as well. The flight to Barcelona took about 2 hours (man, we were excited to be back in Spain!) and then we hopped on a train to Figueres, which took another two hours, where we were picked up.

We had arrived at our next and final stay of this trip. How weird. But Sant Nicolau was the perfect place to end our trip. We met many kind and warm hearted people, were surrounded by beautiful nature which reminded us of the Netherlands due to everything being so green. And all the animals made me feel like a child, once more. We stayed with Francis and Helen and they rent out seven cottages. The location is great but they themselves make the place so magical and alive. We helped out with their chicken coop, fed the animals everyday and made a video for them which will be online soon! Our three weeks there were truly great.

We took walks, visited Figueres and the Dali Museum, we went to Girona for a day, baked vegan cakes and enjoyed group lunches! Looking back now, our whole trip made me realize how simple life is. Life isn’t always easy but it is always simple. And lots of things, most things are all annoying distractions.  

I miss Spain already, I miss the traveling, the unknown, meeting new people but family, friends and ‘the familiar *everything*’ welcomed us.

*Besides, I brought with me an overflowing and excited heart and an eager and curious mind. Tom asked me, if I was ready to go to the Netherlands once more and I did not really have an answer to that question yet but now I think I do… Let the next adventure begin!*
