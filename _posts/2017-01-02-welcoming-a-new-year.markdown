*It’s January, it’s 2017. As long as I can remember I always have had a hard time wrapping my mind around time. It is the strangest concept ever if you ask me. Tom and I celebrated this past christmas and new year’s eve very low key. In Tom’s words “It was pretty much like any other day.” I thought about it for a second and replied “well, that’s pretty much what it is anyway.”*<!--more-->

This time last year we were in Budapest, Hungary. Throughout the year we also traveled to and explored Southern Italy, Northern Spain, we were back in the Netherlands for four months and in October we flew from Amsterdam to São Paulo and continued traveling through southern Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and well here we are.

Last year when we were in Budapest I did not have the slightest clue where we would be this new year’s eve. Not too long ago I was having a conversation with someone and we both agreed that ‘having no plan is a plan’ and along the way I realized that’s my plan. I have always followed my gut feeling. If it feels good, do it. If it scares you, excites you, do it. Do not rationalize it all too much. Trust your heart, trust the universe. Take a deep breath and another one.

I gotta be honest, if my future is too set in stone it uneases me. I do not want to know what I will be doing one year from now, let alone what I will be doing five years from now. I do not want to know where I will be. The possibilities, the spontaneity, the gut feeling they are what I need to feel free, they are what I need to feel alive. 

*And I know I am the luckiest woman alive to have found someone who understands the gut feeling, who is as thirsty as I am for the endless possibilities and who appreciates the simplicty of life.* 

Since writing this I have this quote stuck in my mind ‘If it is right, it happens – the main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away’.
