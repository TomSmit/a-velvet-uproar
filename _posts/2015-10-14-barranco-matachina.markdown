*The airplane is flying above Málaga but due to some problem down at the airport we cannot land, we have to wait. The plane circles and circles in the air and due to strong wind there is lots of  turbulence. I squeeze Tom’s hand, he smiles at me, I bury my  face in his arm. I think to myself “Let us touch the ground, let us touch the ground. Please, now, please.” while we are still circling.*

Yes, I will be the first one to confess I am a big coward when it comes to flying. So when we finally touched down in Málaga I was utterly relieved. Once we had our backpacks we headed for the bus (and another one after that) and we were on our way to Almuñécar. (Almuñécar is about 60 km away from Málaga.) The bus took us along the coast and the both of us were mesmerized by the small, white villages we saw up against the ‘mountains’. I was jumping up and down in my seat when I saw cactuses, agaves, palm trees. Cactuses mean warmth.

We were picked up in Almuñécar by Jake and the drive up to their house took about 30 minutes. We drove passed cherimoya trees, avocado trees, orange trees… from that moment on, I knew, I like southern Spain. We stayed in a caravan plus we had our own shower, sink and toilet which were outside of the caravan. The first couple of days were still a bit cooler but soon enough the temperature was rising and I think, from that point on, it never stopped rising. We started to get to know the place, the work that needed to be done, we walked through the nearby area and fell in love with their dogs Fresa, Churro, Rosy and Diny and learned how truly kind and inspiring Jake and Nadine are. 

We stayed at Barranco Matachina for four months, so yes, also during extremely hot July. I fell in love with cherry tomatoes (they are like some kind of sweet candy), oranges and mandarins, the hens oh, I think the list is endless! I am forever grateful how much we learned about how to grow our own crops, fruits and herbs and for having the opportunity to learn by doing it ourselves. Harvesting onions, garlic, potatoes, green beans, peas, tomatoes, sweet corn, cucumber, courgette, aubergine, peppers, chillies yes, this list is endless as well! We got extremely lucky with the food that was cooked out of these home grown products, oh it was so good! 

Tom was seriously harassed by mosquitoes, I on the other hand was perfectly fine. I was re- introduced to the magic of the Aloe Vera (Hello wonderful day creme), we met the Spanish and kindest 80 year old neighbor, we ate amazing bread from the local baker (who uses a traditional wood heated Moorish oven), down in Almuñécar I fell in love with the flower called 'bird of paradise’ and my obsession with cactuses and agaves turned serious, we both grew an affection and dislike (just kidding!) towards the bougainvillea, I learned to eat spicy food and I started painting. (But more on that in my next post!) 

Once Tom got his guitar back, (his father brought it with him when he drove down to southern Spain) he played and sang every single day. It was so nice to hear these familiar sounds again. The way the sounds swam in the warm air, surrounded by this beautiful nature, it was like it belonged there.
Most of the days it was just the two of us. (Jake and Nadine both work away from home.) Sometimes we would work in silence, simply because it felt nice. Other times we would have passionate talks about organic food, chem trails, our point of view on living etc. Knowing there is someone who shares the same opinions and views on the world is relaxing. To know that there he is, the one I do not have to explain myself to. These inspiring, passionate conversations were a wonderful source for several of my paintings.  

On Mondays we went into Almuñécar and these became our sitting by the beach, strolling through the old town or having some ice cream -day. Early on in our stay we decided we wanted to eat much less sugar. So no more chocolate, cookies or other stuff. Monday was our exception to the rule -day and I think because of that starting to eat less sugar was not as difficult. Throughout our stay the meat eating, food question remained. When we first arrived at Jake and Nadine’s place we simply started eating meat again. I think mostly due to the fact of not seeing ourselves as vegetarians, yet. Even though for six weeks we barely had been eating meat, fish or seafood at our previous host. I think it was around the beginning of June that we decided okay, no more meat. We will only eat fish and seafood that is caught locally. Avocado is the one thing we truly learned to eat while we were at Barranco  Matachina. Today, I cannot imagine not eating them but back then we were not too sure about them. Its structure in particular was something different, the buttery-ish structure. I just did not know how to eat it or with what. Thanks to Jake and Nadine who showed us the perfect combination of avocado and orange and Nadine’s guacamole made us rethink our opinion on the wonderful avocado. Thank you, thank you!

And then there was July. When July arrived days turned quite hot, 38 degrees was not rare, there were days it was about 40 degrees. But you do get used to it. A cloudy, 22 degrees day is a bit chilly to us now. I, I pretty much loved the sun 99% of the time. Even Tom, the one who likes the cold so much, truly enjoyed the sun. Only some nights when the heat would not leave the caravan, it would be a bit too hot to even simply fall asleep. Work wise we started early to not be working in the middle of the day in the blistering heat, we wore our straw-hats and brought a big bottle of water  with us. Working outside, having your hands in the earth is something magical, something powerful. 

*Tom and I made a video together where Tom performs his song 'Let’s go’. The shots in the video were taken by me and at Barranco Matachina. If you would like to see the video, you can view it [here](https://vimeo.com/139969947).*
