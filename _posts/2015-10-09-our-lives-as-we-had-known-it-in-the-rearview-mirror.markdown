*Packing, emptying our apartment, ‘goodbye’ parties and arriving at our very first host in northern Italy, pratolungo. January 2015 was our last month in our apartment in Zwolle. On February 10th (a day after Tom’s birthday) we flew from Amsterdam to Milan, Italy. The last ten days we spent at my parents’ place, busy with packing, 'goodbye’ parties and saying 'goodbye’ in general. Due to busy days it all became a bit of a blur so smaller details are lost in time and my mind.*

Two things we knew for sure we wanted to learn (more) about while traveling were, number 1 learning as much as possible about growing our own crops/fruits/herbs and number 2 learning as much as possible about 'Earthships’. Of course we had our other reasons for traveling as well but these two were the main, priority ones.

January 2015, packing our stuff into boxes and throwing away as much as possible. (I am a sucker when it comes to throwing stuff away. Lots of things were either my grandma’s, my aunt’s, stones from Italy, self made decorations and I just cannot bring myself to throwing those items away.) In the end I was quite proud of myself, we had one whole room filled with everything that was either going to charity or, no matter what, had to be put into the bin.

As February 1st arrived and everything was packed and done apartment wise, I gained the head space back to be able to focus on what to put into my backpack. What to bring, what not to bring. Looking back now, eight months later, I absolutely definitely over packed. But it is true what they say, no one can tell you what to bring and what not to bring. You have to experience it all by yourself. You have to carry the weight yourself and wonder what on earth did I put inside of here?! So back then, I was quite content about my selection of clothes, notebooks and toiletries. Our departure date grew closer and we started saying 'goodbye’ to family and friends. We threw a 'goodbye’ party and a couple days later we headed for Schiphol, Amsterdam.

After a two hour, comfortable flight we landed at Malpensa airport. Once we landed excitement was racing through me combined with a feeling of being absolutely positive of knowing we are onto something good. Heading from the airport to the trainstation I was already getting a bit uncomfortable with my (heavy) backpack but after finding out where to go and which trains to take I was able to relax and enjoy myself. From Malpensa airport we took a train to a nearby village to get on our next train to Novara. Once in Novara we had to get from one trainstation to another. The quickest way of getting there was by crossing the, about seven, railways. First I wasn’t sure about crossing them, the crossing gates were down so what if a train would come? After contemplating what to do, even seeing elderly ladies crossing the railways and Tom telling me “Come on, you are in a different country now, other unwritten rules and behaviours! Let’s go!” I decided to cross, knowing that sometimes I shouldn’t listen too much to the 'what if’s’. Yes a train might be coming, I have eyes, I can see. I’ll be just fine. From there we took another train towards Pratolungo and from there we would be picked up and brought to 'Casa Bisetti’.

We were warm heartedly welcomed by Kitija and Michael, they showed us our room and in and around Casa Bisetti, Casa Bisetti is exactly what I imagined a warm, self improvised house lookslike. It is so very much alive because of all the different people which stay there for a certain period of time.

The day before our arrival two other guys had already arrived. Nate from the USA and Mario from Spain. The next day Tyran from Australia arrived plus that same day we headed for Centro d'Ompio. To get there you have to walk up quite a steep road, it took me about 15 to 20 minutes (the 20 minutes being on a slow day). Every day the walk up was different. There were days I truly enjoyed it, sometimes it was quite do-able and some days my legs were yelling at me 'What the hell do you think you are doing?!’ But every time, every single one of us was rewarded with a stunning view.

*As you might have noticed I tend to write about 'goodbyes’ and 'goodbye parties’ with single quotation marks. This is due to my belief that no such thing as a goodbye truly exists.*
