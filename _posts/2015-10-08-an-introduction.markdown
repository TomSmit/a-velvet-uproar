*It took me a while, eight months to be exact, to decide to write down ‘our’ journey. Traveling to me, is about experiencing it, doing it. 
<!--more--> 
Words aren’t an obstacle in that sense but it is more a question of, are they necessary? The reason why I did decide to write it down lies in my desire to 'want to remember’, memories hidden inside written words are, to me, a form of magic just like traveling itself.*

The start, began before our departure date. Even before we had to pack our backpacks, before we had to get our picture taken for our traveling documents and even before we created our profile on 'HelpX’ in October 2014. It began  in Zwolle, we lived on the fourth floor in a small but cozy apartment. I lived together with Tom. I worked, he worked. I can still remember clearly what is was like the first couple of times when I went grocery shopping. Being able to pick and choose everything we wanted. It felt good. But every time I went grocery shopping questions started to pop up into my mind. Like, my dear, lovely fruit, where do you come from? What do people put inside my loaf of bread? What do people put inside the olives Tom loves so much? I want capers but not the other 101 'ingredients’ people put inside them. Back then, my beloved (organic) eggs what are the living conditions the hens are in?

Tom was doing charity work at a place called 'Doepark het Nooterhof’ in Zwolle. A place where they have educational gardens and where they grow veggies/fruits/herbs and where you can have a drink and something to eat all prepared inside this wonderful building called an 'Earthship’.

While traveling by train from Zwolle to Zutphen one would pass more 'Earthships’ close to Olst and it would always make me happy to see how far they would have gotten building them each time I would pass them and just the buildings themselves are absolutely beautiful as well. What is an 'Earthship’? An earthship is a self sustaining house. Explaining it in a very simple way it is a house where the sun is the main source of energy. (Mainly fulfilling the role of the central heating.) Where you use solar power and wind for energy, where you collect rainwater and use it four(!) times, where you have 'indoor’ greenhouses and it is built out of recycled materials like tires, glass/plastic bottles etc.

These two factors made us start to think about all the other options which are possible and they made us realize there is so much to learn. I wanted to leave this 'way of living’ behind where you work, work, work to be able to live. Of course I also wanted to see new and different things, meet new people, experience something new, and to develop myself artistically while traveling and to merely enjoy myself. So, like I said back in October 2014 we created our 'HelpX’ profile (and later we also created a 'workaway’ one.) What these websites provide is a place where volunteers and hosts 'meet’ and by helping out you get a bed and food in return. (Usually you work about 4 to 5 hours a day, 5 days a week.)

*That is where it began, with questions and disagreement on the current system and society. And with a desire to live a life full of freedom, the sun (lots of it), new connections, the endless possibilities and the thousands of lessons we knew we would learn.*
