*I could tell you all about my reasons why I do not believe in Valentine’s day or I could focus on the fact that it was my grandparents’ wedding day. Love is a powerful, mind boggling ungraspable thing, don’t you think? It comes in all these different ways; forms and somehow it is also this one big thing. Love, oh love I keep finding you everywhere I go.*

My family holds hands without having to hold hands you know? I just know they are always there, always loving, always caring. There are no limits, no boundaries, no matter how far away I might be, I can always, always feel their unconditional love. My father’s voice through the phone makes me wish I could show them what I am seeing, makes me wanna be able to let them feel the sun warming my cheeks on their endless, gray winter days. I wish I could hug them, give my mom the most beautiful bouquet of flowers, tell my father how proud I am of him and go on walks with my sister and her dog. 

My grandmother seems to be the person who invented love. A couple days ago someone wore the same perfume she used to wear, man, scents hold vivid memories. I miss her and it is the kind of missing where you know, there won’t ever come an end to the missing. I tattooed the two Dutch words ‘maar fijn’ on my skin which if I would translate them I’d go with ‘oh well’. Two words, to me, my grandmother used to say quite often. I remember her saying them. In Dutch we have no word for where I decided to get these two words tattooed. A so called 'accidental gap’ in English and in Dutch we call it a 'taalleemte’. We have no word for 'the back of your elbow’, placing my grandmother’s words there, held something magical to me.

I never knew one can feel this soft spoken, warm buzzing, limitless love towards another human being but I  know now. He holds my heart, he knows its beating, knows the soft spots, knows it inside and out. He holds my heart, I hold his. 

I have fallen for all the beautiful flowers and I do not even recall when it happened. I keep searching for color and I keep finding it everywhere. My mind runs wild with excitement. Each genuine smile, each genuine word inspires me. At our current stay they have a three month old puppy and its excitement, its genuine, real excitement reminds me of my own mind. No matter how silly that may sound. I used to not see the beauty of food. I used to not always taste the beauty of food. Certain things require you to take a step back and just take it all in. In Budapest I found this stop sign (pictured above) with a sticker over it with the word 'art’ on it. When I found it, I kept repeating to myself 'Stop. Start. Art’ over and over again. And really those three words describe my life maybe even a bit too well. 

*So this is not a simple note to love. Instead it is a hug on the days you need it, on the days I need it and on all the other days in between.*
