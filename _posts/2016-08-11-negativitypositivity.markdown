*Yes, in this case as well, I can speak out of my own experience. While traveling you can, of course, also encounter an unpleasant situation, less kind people or moments you did not necessarily want to experience. In this case, traveling is not excluded from the negative but I think there is a huge but and maybe that goes for life in general. Maybe first, let me give you an example.*

As you might know Tom and I are traveling from place to place. At every place we help people out. For example we help them out with maintaining the land, with building, with animal care, with house choirs but you can also think of media things such as photography, videos, brochures etc.

In the past eleven months, I have to say, everything has been very positive and to me it felt like we were always on the same page with the people we encountered. Such as the understanding of what needed to be done, how things needed to be done, what was expected, things we could do and so on. But like my mother said “There is a first for everything.” When something is different than what you were expecting or if something happens which you feel unsure, confused and/or unhappy about the question remains ‘What are you going to do?’ Are you going to feel angry, unsatisfied and/or disappointed? Will you take this experience and turn it into a ‘lesson learned’? Or will you feel bitter?  

I, very much, feel like something at first can seem like something negative but you can choose to turn it into something positive and learn a thing or two from it. I have learned to not always let other people’s energy influence me so much. Plus when something seems like an unpleasant situation, I can always choose to focus on the beautiful and happy things. I mean, the sun still feels warm on my cheeks, the daffodils still have this strong, surprising, interesting scent and the olive trees I see during the train ride are big, huge. Their trunks seem so old, proud and heavy and they curl around themselves in such a way, like they know exactly what they are doing. A couple days ago I was sweeping the porch and a buzzing bee surprised me. “Are you here already, in January?” Was all what came to mind. The moment seemed to stretch itself while easy happiness filled my mind. Just a couple hours later the buzzing bee turned into loud shouting and my mind turned into the thing which was buzzing.

Life has a tendency to kinda work along these lines; 'What you choose is what you get’. If you choose to feel unsatisfied, you will be unsatisfied. If you choose to focus on the positive, the positive will come to the forefront. If you know you did everything you could have in a certain situation and/or you truly did not mean to hurt someone, I believe you can let things go. Maybe truly knowing and feeling this way about yourself takes experience, time and self confidence and not in any specific order.

*And yes, yes! Life remains a paradox. We need sadness; the disappointment to know what true happiness is. We need the moon to know the sun. We need tears to know our own genuine smile. We need options to be able to choose. So please, for goodness sake, for you own sake(!) choose wisely.*
