Somehow March has a tendency to remind me of the soft pink color of blossom flowers, the soft sunlight and its soft warmth on my cheeks, tall glasses of water and the not so soft amounts of  inspiration lurking around each corner. I like March and so I decided to dedicate it to a number of things. First off I told myself to drink at least six glasses of water each day, along with practicing my Spanish everyday and to focus on all sorts of inspiration plus to paint, often.

I feel like somehow March is this soft thing, this sweet thing but at the same time, sometimes, my feet, my fingers, even my face, are still frozen. Today I am starting off with my first inspiration post of this month and with who else could I start off then with Frida Kahlo. 

* Please note that I do not own any of the visual content and of course any of the quotes shown in this post.

“My painting carries with it the message of pain.” 


“At the end of the day, we can endure much more than we think we can.”

“Nothing is worth more than laughter. It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light.” 

image
“I am not sick. I am broken. But I am happy to be alive as long as I can paint.”

image
“You didn’t understand what I am. I am love. I am pleasure. I am essence. I am an idiot. I am alcoholic. I am tenacious. I am. I simply am. You are a sh*t my love.” 

image
“I want to be inside your darkest everything.” 

I could say and maybe, endlessly explain why I find her and her work inspiring but I think her work and her words say/show it all. In my opinion it is full of beauty, imperfection, life itself, color, pain, happiness and tragedy. It is so extremely personal and at the same time it is so relevant to every single one of us.

Life, life, oh life.
