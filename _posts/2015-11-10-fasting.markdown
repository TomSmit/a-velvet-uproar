*What is fasting exactly and why would one do it? How does it work? What are the benefits? Plus isn’t it very difficult? Just a couple questions that I was wondering while I was contemplating to either fast or not. Here in this post I will talk a bit more about why I did it, what my experience was like and the things I realized among other things.*

What is fasting exactly? Well, there are many different ways of fasting. I fasted for three days while not eating but still drinking water. Some people fast for a longer period of time, some do not drink while fasting, some, for example, only eat apples. When you fast your body, obviously, reacts to it. But in what way? It pretty much kick-starts stem cells into producing new white blood cells, which fight off infections. This was my reason for fasting. I, for about a week, was not feeling too well. I was not sick but I could feel my body not being its normal self. I read into fasting and lots of people around me at the time had fasted before and helped me clear up my mind with certain questions I had. 

I decided to fast for three days and it was my very first time. I would not eat anything but I did decide I wanted to keep on drinking water. Two days before I started fasting I reduced my food intake. The first day I only ate breakfast, a big lunch and a banana at night. (Since March this has been my eating habit and I am still eating like this. What I mean by only eating these meals is to not have any little snacks in between.) My second day I still ate breakfast, which this time around contained out of only fruits and I ate lunch but I mostly ate salad and a little bit of cooked food. 

My first day was the toughest. My stomach was determined about wanting food. I kept imagining good dishes, nice fruits, cashews and peanuts. But especially during the second day those thoughts disappeared and while I saw other people eat, I realized a human being eats quite a bit. When I saw people eating breakfast, in between snacks like fruits then lunch and so on I started wondering how much food do we need? And at times is eating a habit? As something to do, or thinking you are hungry when you are actually not. I was at the end of my second day and yes, at times I was hungry but I was not starving. Especially all those snacks seemed not necessary. I remember thinking on my third day, OK so tomorrow I can eat again. Now what? How will my body react to food again? When thinking about food everything seemed like too much and too heavy. Even a banana seemed too filling. On the internet and the people around me all said “Take it slow when you start eating again.”  I really took that to heart and was determined to be cautious about how much I would be eating, once I could. I think especially due to the fact that I was a bit unwell before I started fasting my energy level dropped drastically plus I got a bit dizzy as well while walking. To go to the bathroom on the third day Tom walked with me. At finca la Sacristia I had to walk about 50 meters to get to the bathroom but I had to walk a bit upwards as well and it felt like a smart decision to not walk alone. 

After my three days of fasting I ate half an apple for breakfast, one whole apple for lunch and half a banana for dinner. With each fruit though I felt completely full. Like I could not fit anything else into my stomach. My tip: do not underestimate the fourth day! The days after the first one I slowly started eating more and more. More fruits for breakfast and I think on my third or fourth day I started eating oats again. For lunch I started with salad and later into the days I started eating cooked food again. It is very smart to not eat too much and to listen very carefully to your own body.  When my body was strengthening with food, I felt healthy again. No longer did I feel ‘under the weather’. This, as I have written above, was my main reason for fasting. I truly, really learned that the body and the mind are both curious and inspiring.

If maybe at a certain time you are considering to fast for yourself I would advice to thoroughly browse the internet, listen to your body and to enjoy the experience!
