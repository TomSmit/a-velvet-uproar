*Recently I watched the documentary ‘Earthlings’. A documentary I would describe as intense but real. In my opinion it shows you the definition of animal cruelty.*

I knew this documentary was explicit. It shows you everything from A to Z without skipping parts that might be (too) difficult to watch. There are images stuck in my memory, which I do not think I will ever get rid off. But I think it is so very important to really know what is going on in for example slaughterhouses, circuses, the leather and fur industry. Earthlings exists out of five parts: 1. Food 2. Pets 3. Clothing 4. Entertainment and 5. Scientific research. Shot with hidden cameras, I kept asking myself, throughout the whole documentary how can people do this? How can this all be happening? How can people be so cruel?

It showed me reality, the real harsh reality and I believe it is very important to not shy away from the truth. Simply because it is so cruel, unpleasant and horrific.
