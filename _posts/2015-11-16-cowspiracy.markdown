*Today I want to talk about a documentary I recently watched; Cowspiracy. In my opinion it is an informative and eye opening documentary. So what does it talk about? And why in my opinion should everyone watch it? If your interested read along!*

What is it about? As you might have guessed by its name, it talks about animals, about animal agriculture in particular. What it is doing to our planet and why no environmental organizations want to talk about this big issue. Of course I do not want to tell you everything because I would love for you to watch it as well! 

There are shocking numbers being shown. Like how all the traffic combined produces 13% of the greenhouse gasses and CO2 pollution but animal agriculture produces  a staggering 51% of the pollution! Also not just CO2 but a more potent and destructive methane gas. Some other big topics that are discussed are, how much water is being used for all the livestock and the amount of rain forest of the Amazon that is being destroyed because of it. Having those numbers shown right in front of your face is confronting but really showed and told me something has to change ASAP.

I heard that Cowspiracy is available on Netflix in the Netherlands right now and I would really recommend you watching this. I learned lots while watching this documentary and I think spreading awareness of what is going on with livestock and all its consequences is important.
