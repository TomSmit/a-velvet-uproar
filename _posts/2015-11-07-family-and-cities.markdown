*At the end of July we left Barranco Matachina after four months, being at one place for that long and then leaving, yes it was a bit strange but of course always exciting as well! We met some family in Ronda and later we met my mother in Málaga. And let’s be honest mothers are magic, just like traveling itself!*\

Our backpacks were unpacked for four months and after those four months it was a bit astonishing to see what we had fit into our backpack before. Man, so much stuff, too much stuff. We left early in the morning at around 6 AM to catch our bus at 7 AM. We decided to leave early to be able to arrive quite early in Ronda. Where my niece together with her family was enjoying their vacation. From Almuñécar to Ronda it took us about three hours and we stayed with them for four days. The ride up to Ronda was beautiful, the landscape looked so different than what we had been seeing for the past four months! And of course then there is family! Familiar faces, their kindness, their joy plus of course hearing your own language again it is always, always nice! They showed us Ronda which is very beautiful and is especially known for its bridges, the one I got to see is called ‘Puente Nuevo’ and it is the tallest one (120 m.). Ronda is built on top of a cliff (which obviously also explains the bridges, it makes Ronda a very interesting and beautiful place to visit! The next day all of us visited Córdoba and Córdoba was really hot (about 45 degrees Celsius). But obviously filled with beautiful sights to see! The 'Mezquita-Catedral de Córdoba’ is a very well known one but unfortunately it was closed when we were there. We crossed the 'Puente Romano de Córdoba’ by foot during sunset and strolled through town which I can definitely recommend as well!

Our second day we took it slow and went to the nearby natural spring with a waterfall and a cave! It was a bit too chilly for me to go for a swim but the sight itself was more than worth it.

On our last day we left very early in the morning and took the bus back to Málaga to meet with my mom! Seeing my mom again was fun and weird. Seeing someone you know so well in a place you do not know very well is exciting. We stayed in an airbnb apartment and to get to the city center we had to go by bus or metro. (The metro in Málaga is still very new and not a whole lot of people were using it. It was a nice, quite way of traveling.) Traveling by bus is more busy but also a bit more cultural. Spanish people talking to each other rather they know each other or not. The whole experience is quite lively. Of course I had to show my mom the Picasso museum plus we went to see his birth place. We visited the CAC Málaga  which is the modern art museum of Málaga and there was a very interesting exhibition going on, lots of very political art work. The area where this museum is located is known as the ’Soho’ neighborhood. There is lots of graffiti as part of Maus Málaga, very cool!

We also went to the beach and swam to cool off, we went to the castle called 'Alcazaba’, very beautiful and definitely worth a visit! It is a Moorish castle with an amazing view overlooking Málaga! We went to the museum of music where we could play some instruments! Fun! I sounded amazing on the violin! (Just kidding!) And Tom obviously sounded lovely on the piano. Of course I had to find some vintage stores (which by the way were not very easy to find.) My favorite is called 'Epoca Segunda Mano’.

I think I can speak for the three of us and say all in all we had two fantastic weeks combined with lots of good food, good weather and of course, each other’s company!

Saying goodbye to my mom was strange, seeing her drive off in a taxi all by herself and realizing our own adventure continues.

*Family is magic and seeing Spain with them was magic. Thanks again for such a wonderful, warmhearted and love filled time, mom, Evelien, Victor and my epic cousins!*
