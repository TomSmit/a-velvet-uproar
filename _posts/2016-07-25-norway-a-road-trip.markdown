*Tom looked at me funny when I said to him “you should write a little something on your trip through Norway, that’ll be nice.” “Nah,” he replied. “That’s not really my thing.”*

So, I guess you could say this is going to be a bit more of a quieter post. Which I think is a nice change as well. We’ll just leave you with the photographs to look at and that’ll be it. The photographs he took warmed my heart. It was so nice seeing what he had been seeing. It was like he brought with him this treasure box. I was as a kid so excited. Photographs do that to me. I could look through old photographs for hours and hours on end. They can carry so much emotion, a feeling, a vibe, an atmosphere.

Tom traveled together with his father through Norway for approx. 2 weeks in a campervan headed for the house where he and his family lived in for a brief moment. Here are his photographs!

*Pictured below; Driving to the Jotunheimen mountain area. Where also the highest peak of Norway can be found, which is approx. 2500m above sea level.*

*Pictured above; The house he and his family once lived in, is located on the island of Hovden. When he was ‘round about 11 years old.*

*Pictured above and below; sceneries from Hovden.*

When I saw all these photographs I felt so extremely happy for Tom. So glad his own eyes saw all of that, his being walked the Earth over there. I could picture him, his body shiftly moving, his wavy long, golden hair in the wind and his soft, excited eyes ready for what was then, yet to come. 

Being away from one another for approx. two weeks after having been together day and night for the past one and a half year was different. And I know the word different doesn’t even cover half of what it was actually like but somehow that’s the best way of describing it. I think.

He told me “when you wrote this, you must have been kinda high on love”. Then he laughed out loud about my description of being able to picture his wavy long, golden hair in the wind. He continued on by saying “don’t forget to mention how, in my opinion, unspoiled, raw and beautiful Norway is.” 

*I, at times, feel if like we together are this one thing. This kind of like clay ball that’s bendable and flexible and working together with two, individual heads. We are very much one thing and we are also very much two different individuals.*
