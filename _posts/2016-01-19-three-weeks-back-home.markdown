*On December the 8th Tom and I flew from Madrid to Eindhoven. Within two hours we found ourselves surrounded by the known. The place where we can easily understand signs, menus and lists of ingredients.*

My family was waiting for us when we landed. I had not seen my mother since August but I had not seen my father and sister for ten months. I have learned though, with family, no matter how long it has been since you last saw one another, when you see each other again it is like that time period of not seeing one another has not happened. In my opinion, the magic of family. Everyone and everything is always familiar.

For three weeks we were in the Netherlands. Those three weeks were filled with family, friends and Christmas. Seeing familiar faces again is somehow something quite strange but interesting. For the past ten months we knew ‘I won’t see one familiar face again, just while walking through the streets or while being in the super market. Pretty much wherever.’ While traveling you have to get to know a place and its people. And that, to me, is very exciting.

I visited Zutpen, Doesburg, Arnhem and Rotterdam. Places I look at as familiar and known, well apart from Rotterdam. I had never been to Rotterdam before and it was an exciting first time! Those other places though, are places where I guess, I can picture myself. I know where I would go, what I would like to see and do.

The excitement to go to the Netherlands surprised me. Of course I was not surprised to feel excited to see my family again but the excitement for the easy comfort of the known surprised me. And maybe it wasn’t even so much that. Maybe it was more the excitement for visiting these familiar places with familiar people. The combination is what makes it magical I believe. \

I have to say though, people have asked me if I was looking forward to going to the Netherlands, my answer was always yes but that it was good to know there was a set departure date as well. To me knowing I was leaving on the 28th of December felt freeing but also made me more conscious of truly having to enjoy each second of every day.

Now maybe, because I don’t know, I am growing 'older’ and/or because being away from my family for longer periods of time, I am incredibly aware of feeling so much love and appreciation towards them. They are such magical, kind and wonderful individuals. The combination of traveling and family sometimes can be a tough one but I learned one’s own happiness always comes first. I believe that is how it should be though.

*We all fill our lives with what we love. Being home is wonderful, leaving home is wonderful and everything else in between is magical, hard, tough, exciting and surprising.*

And last but not least a special shout out to my sister because she keeps on surprising me, she inspires me to keep challenging myself and she is the inspiration for always keeping my eyes open for personal growth. I am forever grateful to have you as my sister, you are a special one.
