*On the 28th of December we flew from Eindhoven to Budapest in less than an hour and a half. I remember when we stepped out of the plane and set foot on solid ground in the cold outside, my breath created condensation. From that moment on, I knew our ten days there were going to be cold and would be like real winter.*

We went to Budapest to visit a good friend of mine and she truly made our stay there wonderful. She knew good places to go to and could tell us lots about Budapest and Hungary. It was my first time there and Budapest truly made an impression. Out of my friend’s stories I already heard Budapest is filled with beautiful buildings, scenery and that it has a good vibe. And truly, truly it is true! Budapest is exciting, lively but relaxed.\

For the past nine months we were in Spain and to be in a place, so different was exciting. Due to a lack of better words I would describe Budapest as a mix of Russia and Paris. Not that I have ever been to Russia but I guess it just kind of gave me that feeling. It somewhat has an old communism feeling to it. Due to gray, square like buildings scattered around the city and old, crippled man who seemed like they had been walking through the streets for ages. But also the freezing cold and the undecodable language is what made me feel like I was in such a different place. But then again there are also very colossal and baroque like buildings and well maintained, cute little parks and squares which made me feel like I was walking through Paris. If I would have to describe Budapest in one word I would go with, diverse.

My friend told me that some people say Budapest is even more beautiful by night. Now, I have to agree, Budapest is beautiful by day but extraordinary by night. All the buildings are beautifully lit. So, if at one point you find yourself visiting Budapest, do go see it when it it’s dark!\

Our three weeks in the Netherlands were literally packed with things we wanted to do and see, people we wanted to visit and of course (a vegan) Christmas. For our time in Budapest we decided we definitely wanted to go do and see things but we also wanted to relax a little and to not be running from place to place. Not doing a million things in one day. Here is a list of the things we did:\
\
**‘The Great Market Hall’ **Is a big, indoor market and the most touristy market of Budapest as well. But it is worth a visit. From the outside it is absolutely beautiful, the building is beautiful. Inside there are lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. One down side, the top floor, in my opinion was filled with quite some ‘less interesting’ items. I guess junk you could call it. *Vámház Körút 1-3.*

**Édeni Vegán\
**Is a cute, vegan restaurant located in Buda. They have a buffet, where you can pick and choose what you want. Also you can order a variety of things which they can prepare in their kitchen. Which is what Tom did. He enjoyed a very tasty seitan burger! *Iskola Utca 31.*

**Hummus Bar\
**Has several restaurants throughout Budapest. The one we really enjoyed is located at *Október Utca 6*. We enjoyed some falafels with hummus, some fries and salad!

**Ruin Pubs **are a real Budapest thing and they are super fun! A ruin pub is a building which, pretty much, is ready to be thorn down. Someone buys the building, makes it into a pub but kinda leaves the building like it is. People visiting can write, draw on the walls etc.

The first one we visited is called **Csendes bár**. And it is a very interesting place. I suggest; take a seat, have something to drink and look around. Each wall is interesting, one has multiple dolls on it, the other one is filled with writing. Tom and I sat in a bathtub cut in two. The vibe is cool, yes, go check it out! *Ferenczy Isván Utca 5.*\
\
The second one we went to is kind of a music bar, it is called **Lámpás**. When you walk down the stairs, you enter an arched cellar. When we went, there was an open stage night. And for a little bit we enjoyed a drink and the music. Tom and my friend’s boyfriend (both bass players) tried to have a go at it as well but it was so busy and so many people wanted to 'jam’ that is was kinda impossible to do.*Dob Utca 15.*\
\
The last one we went to is called **Szimpla kert**. This one was one of the very first ruin pubs. It is almost hard to explain how fun this place is and how 'cool’ it looks. Chairs hanging from the ceiling, ski’s made into a bench, lots of writing on the walls, cool furniture everywhere etc etc!\
\
Also, on Sundays at this place, they have a cute, little farmers’ market. When we went, a friend of my friend was helping out there as well. You can find all kinds of stuff there like veggies, fruit, bread etc. *Kazinczy Utca 14. *Plus the market is open from 09:00 – 14:00.

During our trip I did not visit lots of vintage stores, to be exact I only visited one. Not because there aren’t any because believe me, there are! It just kind of did not happen this time around. There were other things I wanted to do and see as well. Plus it makes the whole 'oh I like this but I cannot fit it into my backpack-dilemma’ a lot easier, haha! The one I did visit is called **Retrock**. It has everything you expect from a good vintage store. The women *and* men’s deparment were both well stocked, cool jewelry and they also had some Mexican and South American clothing with awesome patterns and colors which I absolutely love. *Anker Köz 2.*

We also visited the Museum of Modern Arts called **Ludwig Múzeum** or Kortárs Müvészeti Múzeum. When we were there they had a Pop-Art exhibition going on. (It was actually the last day of that exhibition when we went.) I saw Warhol, Rauschenberg and tons more! *Komor Marcell Utca 1.*

**Gellert Hill – Citadel **is a hill located on the Buda side and from there you have a stunning view overlooking Pest and partially Buda. From there you have a wonderful view on the Buda Castle plus seeing the Danube river with its bridges makes the view perfect. *Citadella Sétány 1.*

We obviously celebrated and welcomed 2016 in Budapest! When I was a child the number 16 was my favorite and lucky number. So yes, when 2016 arrived I felt more than ready for the new year!

On my birthday we visited a botanical garden, the Fisherman’s Bastion and a Turkish bathhouse. Yes, my day was pretty damn good. Let me visit a botanical garden and I am happy. Reason number 1: The inside areas mean warmth and reason number 2: Hello cacti and tropical trees! The botanical garden is called**Füvészkert**and it has about seven thousand plant species. I think the most iconic building is the Pámlaház, a beautiful nineteenth century palm house with a high ceiling partially made out of glass. It is filled with palm trees, banana trees and other tropical plants! Of course they have more greenhouses with more tropical and subtropical plants like cacti, orchids, giant Amazon water lilies and large carnivorous plants! When we were there it was snowing quite a bit but I could imagine the garden outside being in bloom during Spring and Summer and being absolutely beautiful.*Illés Utca 25.*

**The Fisherman’s Bastion**is located on the Buda side and you have to walk up the hills for a bit. (Buda is located on one side of the Danube river and Pest on the other side. Buda is the hilly part and Pest is flat.) From there you have a wonderful view on the Parliament building, the Danube river and Margaret Island! It was designed and built between 1895 and 1902. Plus it is said that it got its name from the fishermen which were defending this part of the city walls in the Middle ages.*Szentharomsag Ter 5.*

We went to the Turkish bathhouse called **Császár Baths **(originally **Veli Bej**) and it is one of the oldest Turkish baths in Budapest. Seriously, when you are visiting Budapest during the winter going to a Turkish bathhouse is a must. I was cold, even Tom was cold and that really means something. Stepping into the water which by itself is a pleasant 40° C, is awesome! The snow which turned my dreads white and which turned my fingers into icicles was all melted and gone when I stepped into the warm water. Oh, I felt like I was bathing in paradise on Earth! Plus it is said that its healing waters date back to Roman times. It was built in the 16th century during the Turkish era. Throughout the years several extensions were added to the core building. There is a swimming pool, a Jacuzzi, steam baths, various saunas and of course the 'octagonal pool’. The hot springs feeding the thermal pools come from the wells of the nearby Lukács Baths and from Margaret Island. The thermal water is known for its healing powers. Plus FYI I read that Budapest is one of the few places where you can experience the original Turkish baths dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. The Turks were the first to turn Budapest’s thermal springs into bathhouses. This bathhouse is, by the way, located on the Buda side. *Árpád Fejedelem Utja 7.*

*Can I recommend Budapest? Definitely. Experience its vibe, the people, the culture. Go sight seeing, walk, take the metro (especially line 3, its metro brings you back to the 70s or 80s. Hell I don’t know when exactly, I wasn’t born yet! But it definitely brings you back in time.) Try decoding the language. I did not get much further than 'Szia’. It means 'Hi’ in Hungarian and I remembered it well because it sounds like you are saying 'See ya!’ in English. Maybe during the summer it is more touristy but when we were there it wasn’t packed and overcrowded which I loved. So, yes definitely go and experience Budapest. It is simply great!*
