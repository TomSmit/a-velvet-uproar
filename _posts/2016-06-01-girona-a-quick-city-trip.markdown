*While we were at [Sant Nicolau](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMasSantNicolau%2F%3Ffref%3Dts&t=YzQ2ODVlMzVlMDUzNjBjM2UwNjljYjM5ZDMwYmFkODg0NzY2MDA3NCxuaTlTaEpWcw%3D%3D) we visited Girona for a day. Girona is my kind of city. Small enough to walk everywhere but big enough to feel like you are wandering around.Compared to the south of Spain, northern Spain is greener, a bit colder but the food in Spain is good everywhere, all the places we have been to the people have been real friendly and northern Spain and Girona for that matter were no exception.*

I told Tom I really wanted to finish this trip in Spain. I think, for the both of us it made sense. Spain has stolen our hearts, we love the language, the food, their way of life, the people. Going to northern Spain was an easy choice. Tom had been to Barcelona before but other than that it was an undiscovered place to us. I had never, ever been before. Not even to Barcelona so we said, let’s go to Catalunya! Tom told me, ‘If we’re going there, I wanna see Girona!’ and so that’s what we did. 

We have seen some cities in Spain, I mean we have been to Málaga, Granada, Córdoba, Ronda, Valencia and Madrid. All of them in some way give off this relaxed vibe. This ‘mañana vibe’, there’s always tomorrow kinda thing. Relax, have a tapa, enjoy the siesta and we’ll just simply see. Girona I liked a lot. And let me tell you why.

When we got to Girona, which was about one hour by train from Figueres, we headed for a bulk store called **Granel Rutlla**. They can be found at Carrer de Rutlla 41. They sell organic products (obviously in bulk) like cereals, flours, legumes, nuts, seeds, coffee, tea, spices etc. These kind of stores excite my heart so extremely. They make me even more excited about the future. Seeing people take action and making conscious decisions, oh. It makes me hopeful, appreciative and excited. Together we can change so much and these kind of stores are such a good example of that. In that same street, by the way, you can find **Inkpressio Ecologica**. A great, well-stocked organic food store. 

Plus we got treated by Temps de Flors which is a flower festival. It was actually the last day of the festival when we were there. We headed for the the city center and oh by the way I, at times, forgot that in Catalunya people speak in Catalan but also signs are written in Catalan. I will never forget when I noticed the sign which read ‘xurros con xocolate’ and I was a bit confused until I realized ‘Hello! Lisa! Catalan!’ But anyway, we headed for the city center and walked along the city walls for a bit and then decided to visit an exhibition with pre-columbian art from Peru from before the Incas. Now, I have to say it inspires me, it excites me, it calms me, it’s almost like coming home. How strange, I don’t know. It was wonderful. After the exhibition we continued our walk through the city center and headed for the cathedral, walked along the Onyar river plus the colorful houses along the Onyar river are a must see. 

We had a seven course vegan meal at **Bionbo**. Seriously if you ever find yourself in Girona, go here.  The thing about Bionbo is, it is not a vegan restaurant. It is not even a vegetarian restaurant but let me tell you, they know how to make delicious vegan dishes! At the store Inkpressio Ecologica, we asked for some recommendations and they told us ‘Go to Bionbo’. Oh, really, best recommendation ever! You can find them at Carrer del Carme 75. While we were having lunch there a parade passed  the restaurant. Men and women were dressed up in traditional South-American clothing, dancing to traditional music while walking through the streets. It was fun to witness! 

*Go to Girona, enjoy, relax. What else can I say?*
