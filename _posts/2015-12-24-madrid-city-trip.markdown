*Before we headed home for the holidays we spent 5 days in Madrid. The city is full of energy, friendly people and endless vegan and vintage options. In my opinion Madrid is pretty damn wonderful!*

We arrived on Friday the 4th and left on Tuesday the 8th. We stayed in an Airbnb, which we have done several times before. it is a great experience in my opinion, you stay in real neighborhoods, with the local people surrounding you. This time around we also stayed in an Airbnb but we ‘only’ had a private room. We had never done this before but it was a very pleasant experience as well. For anyone really wanting to get to know a place I would definitely recommend staying in an Airbnb.

We stayed in the neighborhood called Tetuán and the Real Madrid stadium was located right down the street. This neighborhood is not very close to the city center though so we often traveled by metro. On Friday we did some grocery shopping and after the ‘siesta’ we wandered around the interesting and exciting neighborhood called Malasaña. This neighborhood is filled with vintage stores and small little shops which sell interesting and fun, little products. It is a very trendy neighborhood so lots of ‘cool’ looking restaurants and cafes also, quite some vegan restaurants as well!

On Saturday we walked to the Mueso de América and on our way we stopped and I looked around at ‘BARBY Make Up Madrid’ a vegan friendly cosmetic store. The walk to the museum took us about 40 minutes, once there I could not wait to get in. I might have to explain I have a real weakness when it comes down to Pre Columbian art. It is all so old but so full of detail, expression and messages, it is mind boggling to me. Yes, our time spent there was a great choice!

On Sunday we headed for a big market in the neighborhood called La Latina. I read it is filled with antique stores, which was definitely true but due to the market being so packed and busy we decided to leave early and come back on another day. We headed for the Reina Sofia Museum and wandered around the museum for quite a bit. My main reason for wanting to go to Madrid was to see ‘Guernica’ by Picasso. The painting is huge, overwhelming and powerful in my opinion. We also saw lots of Dali which I was very excited about as well!

I find Madrid a perfect city to just simply wander through. Lots of fun little details, color and endless options.

We ate at a couple good and exciting vegan restaurants but we visited some wonderful vegan stores as well. Here are the places we went to:

Planeta Vegano is an all vegan store. To me, heaven on Earth and oh so handy. It is also very interesting and exciting to see all the options you can have when one eats vegan. Yes, this store is simply wonderful. *Calle Ave Maria 34*

Al Natural actually is a vegetarian restaurant but with enough vegan options. On their menu it tells you which dishes are vegan. Easy peasy! The food was good, the vibe was nice and pleasant and the staff was friendly. *Calle Zorrilla 11*

Sanissimo Healthy Fast Food, Tom and I were walking through the neighborhood Malasaña and I was telling Tom how I would love to find some vegan cake. Not much later we passed this store/cafe and outside written on their, I don’t know, small billboard it said* vegan cakes. Hello! Exactly what I was looking for. We shared a carob cake while enjoying some tea and coffee, Calle San Vicente Ferrer 28.

VEGA is a 100% vegan tapas bar and restaurant. To me this restaurant felt real Spanish and that is what I loved about it so much! The food is very tasty, it looks amazing if you ask me and everyone was very kind! Calle de la Luna 9.

We actually visited these places listed above before our city trip to Madrid. Because our hosts we were staying with lived so close to Madrid we already had the opportunity to visit Madrid a couple times.

Veggie Room is another fun store. Enough options for anything vegan pretty much. From cosmetic products, chocolate bars to products for you pets! San Vincente Ferrer 21.

Mama Campo is a restaurant but around the corner there is a grocery store as well! We both enjoyed a nice and hot cup of chocolate (made out of soja drink). Afterwards we had a look in their store. Both places look fresh, light and trendy. The store sells good products and is also definitely worth a visit! Plaza de Olavide and Calle Trafalgar 22.

Navarro Herbolario like we did in Valencia we also paid this super market a visit in Madrid. It is a health food store chain. It is well-stocked with tons of organic food, cosmetics, household products etc. Calle Fuencarral 138 and Calle Alcalá 19.

JUSTO AKÍ ekoethicshop is a cute, little vegan shoe store! We did not need any shoes but we wanted to have a look anyway. The store is small but definitely worth a visit! I especially liked the flipflops they sold. Calle Cardenal Cisneros 20.

BARBY Make Up Madrid is a cosmetic store with quite some vegan options. I had never been to a cosmetic store before where the sell vegan products. (Recognizable because of the vegan logo.) Calle Raimundo Fernandez VillaVerde 23.

*I used both [Happy Cow](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.happycow.net%2F&t=NzIyYzM0NTNkOTA2MjRhMDY5MGFjZWEyYjI5Y2JkYjE1NDc3N2U5MyxDYXRLckJyNA%3D%3D) and [Vegandir](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegandir.com%2F&t=MDczMDA1NGQ4MDAzYjc2MTg3MTliNTI1ZTY1NmQzOGJjMGZkNGQ2ZSxDYXRLckJyNA%3D%3D) to find all these places listed above. They are both extremely handy to find vegan, vegetarian restaurants, stores and supermarkets. Pretty much name it and you can find it!*

On Monday we decided to have an easy and slow day. We did some strolling through Malasaña and we looked for Christmas gifts. This neighborhood is seriously packed with secondhand and vintage stores and my list of good stores would be endless if I would write them all down. If you happen to go sometime just really walk and look around and you’ll find plenty of stores. That’s what I did as well.

Tuesday was our last day. Our flight was in the evening though. So we decided to go and do some stuff in the morning. First we decided to head back to the neighborhood La Latina and we had a quiet look around. While enjoying the antique stores and strolling through the streets. Plus we also paid a visit to the urban garden called Huerto Urbano Comunitario de Adelfas. Located right next to the railroad lines it is an interesting place! Unfortunately it was closed when we were there but just seeing the garden was inspiring. It showed and told me there are so many options and possibilities!

That was my amazing and inspiring trip spent in Madrid! Yes, I can definitely recommend the city and I can give you tons of reasons why but I think I might have given you plenty already.

*Guys, have a wonderful Christmas. Enjoy it wherever you are and whoever you are with. December is coming to an end, let’s spend these last days bathing in love.*
