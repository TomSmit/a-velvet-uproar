*Five years ago, February 9thturned into one of my special days. A special day to me is a day where I like to take a moment and appreciate that particular day, each year again and again. February 9th, is Tom’s birthday. That day reminds me of how grateful and truly happy I am, Tom was born. One year ago on February 10thanother special day was added to my list. One year ago today, we started our travel journey. Now February 9thand the 10thask for a little celebration, appreciation and laughter. Two days in particular which make me smile and remind me to focus on life.*

It is crazy to think it has already been one whole entire year since we started traveling. Time has become a strange concept. It seems to fly but somehow it is never in a hurry either. It knows how to balance itself and it lets you decide for yourself if you want to balance along with it. Because I have had and still have plenty of time on my hands and at the same time do not have enough hours in one day, I learned what I want to focus on. It made me realize what I find important in life. \

Traveling taught and showed me, nothing teaches you as much as experience. Go do something, anything, go do everything. What I find extremely fascinating is to see how people live everywhere. Wherever you will go, you will find people, human beings. You will find us everywhere. Holy f\*ck really, it blows my mind. What also tends to blow my mind is how everywhere I have been I can buy or even better, grow fruit, vegetables, potatoes. There’s water everywhere I went. I cannot process the amounts of for example banana there must be in the world, right this second. I really find it hard to process big amounts of anything. I can’t picture it, I can’t understand where it is all coming from. Of course, I understand, I have seen bananas grow from trees but man, really, these huge amounts blow my mind. It makes me dance, it makes me smile to realize how epic the Earth is. She’s doing some pretty epic shit. Let’s seriously appreciate her and learn a thing or two or three or a hundred. \

Picking cherry tomatoes during misty mornings which turned my cheeks red and my nose runny, washing dishes and saving the water to water the plants or having my fingers covered in earth, nothing to me can beat those small pleasures. It made me realize where I come from, the things we should cherish, the things we should be thankful for and what truly matters to me.\

People are unbeatable. We can be outrageously kind, upset, filled with love, filled with stress. People tend to inspire me the most. We are, we simply are and that, surprise, surprise, blows my mind. \

We started our journey off in Italy and Italy I like your character, Spain oh Spain I could not get enough of you. Nine months were not enough. Your language alone, boy oh boy. Being back in the Netherlands in December let me know real honest how much I sincerely love my family. Hungary, you lit a fire within me which longs for the unfamiliar, the unknown. \

*We halved our luggage but for ever I will carry a heart full of warmth, curiosity and desire for the world, its people and experiencing the simple fact that we all simply are. Here is to life!*
