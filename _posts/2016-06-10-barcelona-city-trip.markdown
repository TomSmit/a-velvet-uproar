*Barcelona! We visited Barcelona back in May. We arrived in the Netherlands a little over 2 weeks ago but to me it feels like quite a bit ago. I am telling you guys, time is the strangest concept ever. But Barcelona was great. We really enjoyed ourselves and finishing off our European journey in Barcelona felt right and exciting.*

Alright, so we were in Barcelona from May 19th until May 23rd. A good couple of days to explore the city in a bit of a slow pace. I loved it. I didn’t feel like we had to hurry to see everything. On May 19th we took the train from Figueres at about 10-ish in the morning and arrived in Barcelona around noon. We took a metro to our Airbnb, dropped off our lugage and we were ready for some food! we walked towards **Enjoy Vegan** and we both really enjoyed their food. They can be found at Plaça de Sant Agustí Vell 11. After our lunch we walked to the Picasso museum (Hello, yes I am a big Picasso fan!) and wandered through the museum. I don’t know, I find so much inspiration but also calmness while walking through interesting museums together with Tom. The walking, the looking, the observing, taking it in and talking and discussing what we both see and feel oh, I love those moments so much. After the Picasso Museum we headed for **Veritas** which is an organic supermarket chain. There are by the way quite a lot of them in Barcelona. Which I found really exciting! Afterwards we walked through the neighborhood called Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera and via the Arc de Triomf we headed for our Airbnb again ‘round about 8 at night.

The next day on Friday we went to the (very touristy) market called **La Boqueria**. Yes, it is very touristy but I would still really urge you to go if you ever find yourself in Barcelona. Seeing all the fruits and veggies, I think is worth it. I find it a joy to walk through a place where all these delicious foods are in abundance. You can find the market at La Rambla 91. It is located in Ciutat Vella (Ciutat Vella means “Old City” in Catalan.) which is a district of Barcelona, which exists out of four neigborhoods. (La Barceloneta, El Gòtic, El Raval and Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i La Ribera.)

We walked around and ended up in this really cool bookshop called **El Lokal**. The bookstore specializes in all things like radical feminism to revolutionary theory. Just FYI all books are either in Catalan or Spanish. You can find them at Carrer de la Cera 1. We had lunch at **Veggie Garden** and we decided to order smaller dishes to kinda do the tapas thing. Yum! Veggie garden is an all vegan restaurant and they are located at Carrer dels  Àngels 3.

Afterwards we took the metro to La Sagrada Famìlia, for the first time I truly felt like ‘Okay, we’re in Barcelona!’ Because it is such an iconic building for Barcelona. We walked around, enjoyed it from up close and from further away. We sat down on a bench and you know, those moments I really cherish. Sitting down, taking a second, taking it all in and realizing I am truly here and here with Tom. Pure joy. Afterwards we walked back to our Airbnb and bought some fruits to eat later in the evening at the beach.

After some relaxing at our Airbnb we walked towards the neighborhood called La Barcelonetta and towards the beach. Luckily because it was not the middle of the day anymore it wasn’t as packed as I had feared. But of course, of course there were still quite some people. Funny enough it was quite easy to stare at the waves, enjoy our grapes and papaya and completely forget about all the other people. Later in the evening we decided we wanted to go to this bar which we had noticed on one of our strolls. The bar is called **Catbar**. Their sign said ‘vegano’ so we knew we had to go there. By the way there are no cats but there are delicious vegan burgers! You can find them at Carrer de la Bòria 17.

*Something about warm, late evenings. A full moon and holding Tom’s hand in mine.*

On Saturday by metro we went to an all vegan store called **Amapola Vegan Shop** and it definitely is worth a visit. Here you can find handbags, shoes etc! They are located at Travessera de Gràcia 129. Afterwards, while walking towards Park Güell, we found a very exciting bakery called **Forn Fortino**. They baked all sorts of really delicious stuff! We bought two small cookies made out of quinoa with raisins!  You can find them at Travessera de Gràcia 145. And then we found another really exciting all vegan pastry place called **La Besnéta**! Just go and eat! They can be found at Calle Torrijos 37. At some point we finally made it to Park Güell and bought tickets to get in for Monday morning. We walked into the part of the park that’s accessible without a ticket and we ate a sandwhich which we brought ourselves. We enjoyed the view overlooking Barcelona, listened to the birds and soaked up some more sun. Later we took a metro to La Raval and before we went in to MACBA (Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona)  we went to some vintage shops!

The next day, on Sunday, we decided we wanted a real Sunday. we slept in for a bit, took it slow and we went to Jardí Botànic de Barcelona by bus. We wandered through the park, enjoyed the colorful flowers plus we enjoyed the view overlooking Barcelona. We took it real slow, sat down, talked, ate some food we brought ourselves and slowly we made our way back to the busstop again.

*Pictured above; my lipstick kiss mark. When Tom looked at it he told me jokingly “It’s like two matchsticks kissed my arm.” Thanks darling…*

We hopped off the bus close to Passeig de Gràcia. There you can find Casa Milà (La Pedrera) and Casa Batlló both constructed by Gaudí. To be honest, I am not really into architecture but this was something else. The shapes, the colors my eyes could not stop looking at it. So enchanting, so beautiful.

By this time, it was about 6PM and decided to walk back to our Airbnb to start packing because we had a flight to catch the next day.

And somehow it got to be Monday. All of a sudden it was Monday. Our last day in Spain for now, our last day of this beautiful journey which taught me so much. Which opened my eyes even wider, which opened my heart and mind.

We could leave our lugage at our Airbnb and we could pick them up later so we could easily explore some more of Barcelona! In the morning we went to Park Güell, this time with tickets. I do not even really know how to discribe it. How every single detail was chosen carefully to create one whole. Even though it was filled with so many other people, I didn’t care. All the beauty surrounding us, realizing this is how we are going to end this journey. I felt so content and happy. So happy.

For lunch we met up with the other volunteers which were also staying at Mas Sant Nicolau. We had lunch at **Biocenter**. It was a joy filled afternoon filled with good company, endless laughing, nice conversations and tasty food!  Biocenter is located at Pintor Fortuny 25.  After saying our goodbyes after lunch we headed for our Airbnb to pick up our lugage. By train we went to the airport and there we were. Tom asked me if I was ready to go to the Netherlands again. All I remember thinking is, I don’t know that sentence. It feels like such an unfamiliar sentence. I don’t know the answer. I guess, maybe I’m half ready and half not ready at all. Maybe it is not about being ready. Maybe it is. Maybe it does not matter and maybe it does.

*There we were, waiting for our flight to depart at 9PM. We would arrive in the Netherlands at 11PM and my father and sister were going to come pick us up. I imagined them, standing there. Waiting for us, smiling. I wasn’t too sure about being ready to going to the Netherlands again but I was sure about wanting to see them again, wanting to hug them again and smiling.*
