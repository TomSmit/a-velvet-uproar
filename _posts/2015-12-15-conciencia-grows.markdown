*After our week in Valencia, we headed for Madrid by train. The train ride took about 8 hours. While we left the seaside behind us, we enjoyed a relaxing ride with stunning views. Spain keeps on surprising us over and over again.*

When we arrived in Madrid we took a metro to where we would be picked up by Kahlyn and Ramón. Their place is about 30 minutes from Madrid. So the city is near but not too close. So we were definitely able to have some peace and quiet as well! Kahlyn and Ramón grow their own crops and sell their products (numerous veggies etc) on markets and to restaurants. If you would like to learn more about them and what they are doing go [here](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FConciencia-Grows-699632066764073%2F&t=ZWU3NmJjNThkMDNjOGRkMGM3OWJmZTk4ODhjYmQ4MzY3ZTRmMTA1NixtUzFZQ3lCWQ%3D%3D).

We spent six wonderful weeks with them. It is always so exciting to see veggies grow and being able to eat Eco products! We enjoyed helping out on the land, Tom helped install a wood stove and I also took pictures for them. We made a video for them as well. It is amazing when you can combine everything you love and bring it all together into this one thing. During our stay lots of changes happened inside their house. When we arrived there was no hot water, no stove, no shower, no windows and electricity was limited due to one solar panel. Stepping out of my comfort zone and living in a way other than what I was used to was exciting. It is one of the ingredients which makes traveling magical.

Both of them are very welcoming, relaxed and friendly. We felt home right away and it is always exciting to learn and do new things. One reason why traveling is so magical is that it includes getting to know new people, new cultures, new food. New and different everything pretty much. It keeps on being the perfect way, for me, to expand and to get to know myself.

*Life can be so good, oh so good!*
