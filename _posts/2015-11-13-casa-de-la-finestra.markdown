*We left finca La Sacristia around 7 AM in the morning. We were driven to Málaga, which was absolutely wonderful, to catch our bus to Valencia. The bus ride took 11 hours. Once in Valencia we took another bus towards Gandia, which was about a 30 minute ride. We arrived in Gandia at 10.30 PM. It was a long day, filled with amazing views. We were picked up by Allan and the drive by car to [casa de la Finestra](http://www.casadelafinestra.com/) took us another 40-ish minutes. Trixie warmheartedly welcomed us and rice with veggie-curry was waiting for us upon our arrival.*

We stayed at casa de la Finestra for three weeks and were astonished by the beauty of the place. The natural surroundings are absolutely lovely. It is so green, especially after being in southern Spain for about 5 months where it is very dry. We could not but notice the greenness. Allan and Trixie created a place where all people and animals are welcome and loved.

For eleven days we house sat their house and took care of their animals, while they enjoyed their vacation in Italy. We met lovely people, enjoyed the pomegranates and kaki’s, went for walks, took care of their garden among other things! Tom turned into a rescuer when Trixie found a kitten in a garbage container, with its head stuck in the drainage hole. (Yes, Tom is such a hero! Haha!) Plus Trixie took me to heaven when we went to Gandia to a store where they sell endless amounts of nuts and seeds!

Tom and I went for a walk and found wild growing purslane and goosefoot (or lamb’s quarters). We got to know both of them at finca La Sacristia. (Where they grow in their greenhouse.) They both taste great in salad! And as you might guess they are healthy as well! Purslane contains more omega-3 fatty acids than any other leafy vegetable plant. It also contains vitamins (A, C, E and B) and dietary minerals (magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron). The leaves of the goosefoot can be eaten. (It does contain high levels of oxalic acid when eaten raw, so it is wise to eat it in moderation.) Plus on our walk we passed some huge orange and mandarin groves. This is what the Valencian Provence is known for by the way. At one of the groves, a whole pile was lying on the ground right next to the gate and of course we had to take and try one! Tom also picked wild growing Rose-Mary. I mean, isn’t it wonderful to be able to pick all these things in the wild? And it being free.   

At casa de la Finestra, we obviously ate vegan as well and most the time we cooked. Especially when Trixie and Allan were away for their vacation. I was and still am so inspired how veganism makes me feel, the endless options which are possible, plus a more green life in general through for example composting, solar power and growing your own vegetables and fruits. I picked pomegranates and kaki’s right from the tree, they use a blue and red garbage bin for composting (a separate one for citrus fruit), which obviously, later will be used in the garden. All inspiring steps to a more green and conscious life. It made me realize I want to share these experiences, ideas, thoughts and lessons.

*The three weeks we stayed at casa de la Finestra flew by! Life truly is great, surprising and one big adventure!*
