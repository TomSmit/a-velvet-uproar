*I cannot believe how fast time flies. This year has been absolutely exciting, surprising and amazing. I learned a lot, I saw a lot of new places and met lovely new people. Traveling is magic, magic, magic, truly.*

Here are some pictures of my year. January existed out of packing and deciding what to keep and what to throw away. January was filled with fresh excitement for our journey coming closer and closer. This year I realized traveling to me is the most real thing but at the same time, so dream-like. 

The last pieces to leave our apartment in primary colors.

In February, a day after Tom’s 24th birthday, we flew to Milan, Italy. Heading for Pratolungo, a small town close to lake Orta. 

In March we continued to enjoy our time in Italy. Plus on March 25th we flew from Milan, Italy to Málaga, Spain. 

Tom smelling wild growing Rose-mary in Spain.

In April the temperature was rising in southern Spain and I never knew I could be in awe over and over again, each morning, because of the beauty surrounding me. Plus I finally, finally started painting and the endless possibilities started to become visible. 

In May we visited Granada and Málaga and continued to stay close to Almuñécar. Life continued to be spectacular.

Because, I guess, no one likes burning hot seats.

The Alhambra in Granada.

I wanted to leave something on a sticky note at the centre Pompidou. I guess ‘Frida’ together with a drawn heart was everything my dazed mind could come up with after seeing my very first Frida painting in Málaga.

June was warm. And wonderful.

July was our last month close to Almuñécar. At the end of the month we visited some family who drove down to southern Spain, plus my lovely mother visited as well and we spent two weeks together in lovely Málaga.

Jake and Nadine, our lovely hosts ask their workawayers to draw/write something on their wall when they leave. We drew these two avocados. And I apparently said ‘holy moly’ all the time and Tom absolutely, definitely said, well those two words all the time!

Family in Córdoba with 45°C.

These green little parrots make noise and I love them.

The first two weeks of August we enjoyed together with my mom in Málaga. Afterwards we headed to our new hosts very close to Málaga. I guess, we could not leave southern Spain behind us just yet.

My mother is pure magic.

September was the kind of month where we started to have cooler mornings and evenings but the days were still hot. At the end of the month we headed for Valencia. Plus I finally got dreads and life continued to be nothing short of perfect. 

It rained in September after about four months of no rain and the yellow/golden morning light was so beautiful, waking up early was no biggie.

When we were staying ‘close’ to Valencia we could not believe our eyes. Everything was so green. 

October started to cool off. We started to need jackets, we house sat and took care of three kind dogs and about 6 cats all with interesting characters. We enjoyed a week in Valencia and then headed for Madrid.

Sunbathing when the sun is still hot but the wind chilly.

Heading for Valencia!

November started to cool off but somehow for the most part, it was still quite warm during the day. I learned that each part of Spain is beautiful and Madrid is big. We lived without hot water, a shower, limited electricity and no windows and without a woodstove for a while. And I learned we, as human beings, truly do not need a whole lot. We can do pretty well without all the ‘normal luxuries’. More on this later but very, very soon!

The result of when washing your hair means throwing a bucket full of water on top of your head, while it is not too warm outside.

At the beginning of December we enjoyed our last days at Conciencia Grows and later we headed for Madrid to enjoy our ‘city trip’ there. Plus we flew to the Netherlands to spent three weeks with family and friends. And now we are in Hungary. It is cold, it is different, it is beautiful. A big part of life is choosing and deciding how you want to live it and I could not be more content. Life is pretty damn good. 

Madrid’s museums are a real dream.

One thing my mother unconsciously taught me is the love for flowers. These flowers welcomed us in my old room, on my old bedstand. 

Messy Christmas kitchen, most warm hearted and kind sister, seriously.

Evi and Tom in cold but stunning Budapest.

And maybe two good sentences to finish this post with ‘Power to the people’ and ‘Go vegan’. I found them written down on the walls of a ruin bar here in Budapest. 

Have a good, fresh and exciting start of 2016! Here’s to another year. Here is to possibilities, days and nights filled with love and a life filled with whatever you want it to be filled with!

*Here’s to eye opening traveling, to new adventures and a magical year!*
