\*I can been strong minded, almost pigheaded and stubborn at times. The thing is, if I feel strongly about a certain subject, that´s it. That´s how I feel about that subject then. Therefore Tom sometimes calls me ´my freedom battler´. \* <!--more-->

And I am like what are you talking about? This is just how I feel. When we arrived at Source Temple and I saw a sign which said something about ´god´ my hair was immediately raised and my mind a bit doubtful. 

After São Paulo and its urban jungle, my mind was nowhere near willing and ready to get into the ´love is all´ vibe. Every time subjects like this were spoken about my mind couldn´t do it. I said to myself ´Come on guys, there´s real horrible shit happening outside this bubble!´ I couldn´t but also didn´t want to get rid of those feelings. I strongly felt like, I don´t want to close my eyes and be ignorant. I need to open my eyes right now and bare my consciousness to reality.
