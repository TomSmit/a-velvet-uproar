*I can been strong minded, almost pigheaded and stubborn at times. The thing is, if I feel strongly about a certain subject, that´s it. That´s how I feel about that subject then. Therefore Tom sometimes calls me ´my freedom battler´.* <!--more-->

And I am like what are you talking about? This is just how I feel. When we arrived at Source Temple and I saw a sign which said something about ´god´ my hair was immediately raised and my mind a bit doubtful.

After São Paulo and its urban jungle, my mind was nowhere near willing and ready to get into the ´love is all´ vibe. Every time subjects like this were spoken about my mind couldn´t do it. I said to myself ´Come on guys, there´s real horrible shit happening outside this bubble!´ I couldn´t but also didn´t want to get rid of those feelings. I strongly felt like, I don´t want to close my eyes and be ignorant. I need to open my eyes right now and bare my consciousness to reality.

Especially my first week there I couldn´t ´go with the flow´. My thoughts kept coming back at me. Hello! There´s life out there! Shit! Pain! Unfairness! Division!

But it made me realize this time of my life, I am focusing on other things then questioning and wondering who I am, what I want and where I am going. It very much feels like during our European trip I asked myself those questions and for now at least I know the answers. Right now I have no desire to go back to that beginning again. Right now, I truly feel like I want action, creation, realiyation. Above all, I think, this time requires different questions.

At Source Temple, as lovely and peaceful as the place was, I couldn´t find room for the things that are boiling within me. I simply couldn´t find what I feel like I need right now and that is okay. Once I realized this being there became easier for me as well.
