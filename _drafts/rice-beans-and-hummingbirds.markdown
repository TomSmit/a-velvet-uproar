*From SÃ£o Paulo to Source Temple. The bus ride to Guaratingueta took approx. 3 hours and from there to our first workaway we shared a taxi, with two other volunteers, which took another 45 minutes.* <!--more-->

Source Temple. Man, really it is still hard to discribe our stay there but especially my very own experience is still tough to write down. I think first and foremost what I should explain is that all thoughts written down apply to me and only me. I would never want to offend anyone. Nor am I saying the way things were done there were 'wrong'. My thoughts merely reflect the feelings I went through and my state of mind when I was there.
