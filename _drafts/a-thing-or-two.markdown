*A few days ago I read the words “The journey changes you; it should change you.” Something I have been thinking about off and on. I have moments where I have difficulty excepting the thought of realizing that the people closest to me do not fully know me, the way I am now. Simply because of not physically being close to each other. I came up with two things. One, my personal growth and changes are my own anyway and two, what is this (human) desire of wanting to share?*<!--more-->

 What is this desire of me wanting them to know I learned, I grew, I changed.

I am less scared, I am more talkative, I am more calm, I appreciate my body more and I give less fucks. At the same time though I also give more fucks for injustice, equality, women, people, all of us, every species, the planet, poverty…

Poetically I could say “A thing or two I have seen and heard broke my heart.” And you know, it’s true, it’s fucking true. I have cried. I’m baffled. How is this true? How can this still be reality? I realize now how warm of a bath Europe is, how warm of a bath the Netherlands is. 

I am real fucking lucky and how sad it is I needed to go somewhere else to truly realize this. I am even more lucky to have had the chance and was able to go outside of what I had always known and to see with my own eyes the flip side of the coin, of reality.  

I strongly feel I have calmed down, I feel very grounded. I know where I come from, I hardly know where I belong and I for sure do not know where I am going.
