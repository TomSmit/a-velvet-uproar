Hi and welcome to our website. We are Tom and Lisa, the faces behind a Velvet Uproar. This website came about through a learning process (in which we profoundly learned that we believe in change) which was a sixteen month long European journey or better called adventure and the desire to hopefully inspire people to believe in change as well.

Since October 2016, we have embarkied on yet another adventure; South America. Throughout our travels we got to know another way of living. Being gentle, warm hearted and kind to the Earth, the animals, to other human beings, to new and other traditions and to oneself. This and more is what we want to focus on throughout our South American adventure and doing so through living a (more) sustainable life by learning and doing, celebrating other cultures, getting to know other traditions and sharing every and all art forms with all human beings.

*The name itself is inspired by the term (a) ‘velvet revolution’ which means a non violent transition of power and the definition of the word uproar; a load and impassioned noise or disturbance. So, in our words; a non violent, impassioned disturbance wanting a transition.*
